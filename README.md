NOTICE
======
Since Wisembly declared that they are no longer maintaining this project, I've
decided to fork this project and continue it. I think the official repository is still
wisembly/elephant.io. But, feel free to use this fork if you wish. If you found some bug,
kindly raise an issue for that.

Installation
============
We are suggesting you to use composer, with the following : `php composer.phar require wisembly/elephant.io`. For other ways, you can check the release page, or the git clone urls.

Documentation
=============
The docs are not written yet, but you should check [the example directory](https://github.com/ghabxph/elephant.io/tree/master/example)
to have a basic knownledge on how this library is meant to work.

Special Thanks
==============
Special thanks goes to Mark Karpeles who helped the project founder to understand the way websockets works.
